- App.jsx
-
- This is the main entry point for our React application.
-
- Key Features:
- - It uses the `react-router-dom` library to set up routing for the application.
- - It defines three routes: the root route ("/"), the "editStudent" route, and the "addStudent" route.
- - The root route uses the `getStudents` function to load data and displays the `Dashboard` component.
- - The "editStudent" and "addStudent" routes display the `FormPage` component.
- - If there's an error loading data for the root or "editStudent" routes, the `ErrorPage` component is displayed.
-
- Components:
- - Dashboard: Displays the main page of the application.
- - FormPage: Displays a form for editing or adding a student.
- - ErrorPage: Displays an error message.
-
- Functions:
- - getStudents: Fetches a list of students from the server.
